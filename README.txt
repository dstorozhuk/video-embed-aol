"Video Embed Field" module.

============
 * Field (core)
 * Entity API (https://www.drupal.org/project/entity)
 * Video Embed Field (https://www.drupal.org/project/video_embed_field)

INSTALLATION
============
 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:

   for further information.

CONFIGURATION
=============
 * Use this field type as usual video field provided by "Video Embed Field".
   The example of correct AOL ON video url should looks like this:
   http://on.aol.com/video/kendall-jenner-accused-of-throwing-money-at-her-waitress-518365417
   http://on.aol.com/video/buffalo-billion--why-an-nfl-franchise-is-getting-low-balled-518364920

 * Also, you can use video ID instead of URL.
   To achieve this, in field settings set 'Use video ID instead of URL'
   (instance section) to "Yes". That's is. Now field accepts the video ID
   instead of video URL.
